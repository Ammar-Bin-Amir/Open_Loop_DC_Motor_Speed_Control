# Open Loop DC Motor Speed Control

The function of speed control in DC motors is very essential in the achievement of desirable outputs. In this project, the speed of dc motor is controlled manually using potentiometer along with the assistance of human. The purpose of this project is to implement the concepts of linear control system and to find out the open loop system's functionality.
