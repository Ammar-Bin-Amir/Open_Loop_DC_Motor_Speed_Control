Develop the above circuit individually.Try to make a robust design so it may not behave abruptly while operation.This circuit has 2 parts, 1) The comparator for the set point and  feedback input, 2) The motor driving  circuit to drive  the small toy motor.This  is the universal circuit with will be usable  for  up coming lab activity's throughout the course. This circuit will help you people to understand the  basic  control parameters in open loop and  close loop circuits. This will improve your capability to handle  the basic  control circuits  with eventually leads  to get the job in the industry inshallah. Thanks  for the  cooperation.
